## Who I am (roughly).

Hi! and welcome to my little internet space. I am hekj, I enjoy IT and I am currently learning programming with Python 3.

Besides IT, I enjoy listening to music, reading and bouldering. 
 
I would probably try to make another page decidated to blogging. I don't know yet. 

Anyway, welcome to my journey!
