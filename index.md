## Who I am (roughly).

Hi and welcome to my little internet space. I am hekj, a junior IT technician currently on a sabbatical to improve my IT skills in order to sit for some certifications and eventually become a sysadmin.

Besides IT, I enjoy listening to music, reading and bouldering. 
 
I would probably try to make another page decidated to blogging. I don't know yet. 

Anyway, welcome to my journey!

Feel free to [contact me](mail:contact@hekj.eu).
